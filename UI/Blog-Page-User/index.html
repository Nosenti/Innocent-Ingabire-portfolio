                  “Writing a book during a pandemic was one of the most
                  challenging things I have ever done,” she told me. Like many
                  working parents during the past few months, she was trying to
                  balance homeschool with the need to accomplish serious,
                  mind-stretching deep work; all without any easy means of
                  finding some peace and quiet.

                  So Jessica went to an extreme: she setup a beach tent in her
                  backyard, so she could work outside without the sun glaring on
                  her laptop screen (see above). She’s not alone in this
                  innovation: I can think of at least two other people I
                  personally know well who deployed similar tent setups in their
                  yards for similar purposes.
